<h2>Help: Signing up or cenceling work shifts</h2>

<p>From the calendar view (Click on "Calendar" in the "Go to" line on the trailer of a page to get to this view), click on the desired meal.</p>

<p>Depending on the anticipated number of diners, the number of available work slots varies. Breakdown of crew jobs is up to the crew. We recommend meeting as a crew before working to split up tasks. Within the meal software, you may specify things like: "I'd like to work on clean-up" by clicking on the "Edit notes" button which appears after your name once you have signed up for a crew slot.</p>

<p><i>To add yourself</i>: Find the desired type of work shift. If there are still open slots, there will be an "Add me" button. Click that and your name should appear.</p>

<p><i>To add a buddy (including yourself)</i>: Find the desired type of work shift. If there are still open slots, there will be an "Add me" button. Click that and a popup window will appear with all your buddies who have not yet signed up for that shift. Check the names of everyone you wish to sign up, then click "Submit". The popup box should disappear, and the names should appear on the meal detail page. If you checked more people than there were slots for, you will receive a warning popup box and not all of your selected people will be signed up. Please check to make sure you are happy with those who were successfully signed up.</p>

<p><i>To cancel work shifts</i>: Click the "Remove" button by the name of the person you wish to cancel.</p>
