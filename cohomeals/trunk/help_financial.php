<h2>Help: Financial log</h2>

<p>Financial accounts are collected into billing groups. Often a billing group is your household. To change your billing group, contact the meal oordinator.</p>

<p>When you sign up or cancel dining for yourself or a buddy, the corresponding amount of money is debited or credited to your account.</p>

<p>When you make a payment to the bookkeeper, walkin to a meal, or purchase leftovers, the bookkeeper enters the event into your financial log.</p>

<p>To view your financial log, click "Financial history" in the "Go to" line in the trailer of a page.</p>
