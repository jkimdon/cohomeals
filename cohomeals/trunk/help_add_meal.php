<h2>Help: Add or edit meal</h2>

<p>Anyone can add wild card or spade meals. Only the meal coordinator can add heart, club, and spade meals.</p>

<p>Once a meal has been created, the head chef or the meal coordinator can edit it.</p>

<p><i>Add a meal</i>: Click on "Add new meal" in the special privileges section of the trailer on any page. Use the drop-down boxes and text boxes to set the details of the meal. At least a suit, date, and time must be set. Other items may be left as the default and changed later. Click "Save" at the bottom of the page when you are ready to save the information.</p>

<p><i>Edit a meal</i>: Go to the meal detail page (usually via the calendar view). Click on "Edit entry" at the bottom of the page. Then edit the meal details using the drop boxes and text boxes.</p>
