questions:


----
todo:
get rid of admin -- only meal coordinator (harder name to guess)
add_entry should be renamed to something like participate_in_meal
deal with ssi
deal with public access
deal with colors, gradient
unsupport languages?
do something with the hour matrix in week view
pare down user preferences
pare down admin preferences (e.g. disable participants)
only timed events
get rid of other supported databases
change about-type stuff
edit connect.php to have beancounter, household, etc
check for extra date converters if get rid of date style preferences
add unit tests for different levels of security access (admin, user, public, etc)
get_my_users is probably not needed since we view all users
security check: get rid of unused functions
deletion
check out the log info -- see if it's what we want
head chef pulldown sorted by who has done it the least
color gray/white to distinguish different lines in the edit/view meal table
prev/next month navigation in easy-to-find spot
for add meal, check to make sure end date is after start date
    and check to make sure there is some day of the week clicked for repeating meals
    add another save button at the top
default time and number of crew should be according to spec
more useful activity log (more descriptive actions)
fix hackyness in top of edit_entry_handler.php
clean up all the includes
organize the date calls (e.g. year, month, today)

security:

done- turn register_globals off
- check inputs and escape or remove funny characters, like ', ", # (see mysql_real_escape_string and get_magic_quotes_gpc)
- make sure you have correctly set "open_basedir" in your php.ini file
- have set "allow_url_fopen" to "off"
- pre-initialize every variable in the file it's used
- change default passwords and usernames, esp admin
- careful of leaving install files on the live site
- doublecheck all visible files and directories
- set error reporting to off on the live site
- delay between password tries
- track ip addresses for login attempts
- views (?) or some way to never delete
- check out: safe_mode, disable_functions, not using eval(), (look at php.ini for some of this)


- consider removing webcalendar_login since no longer use ssi (see login.php)
