questions:


----
todo:
add_entry should be renamed to something like participate_in_meal
deal with ssi
deal with public access
deal with colors, gradient
unsupport languages?
do something with the hour matrix in week view
pare down user preferences
pare down admin preferences (e.g. disable participants)
only timed events
get rid of other supported databases
change about-type stuff
edit connect.php to have beancounter, household, etc
check for extra date converters if get rid of date style preferences
add unit tests for different levels of security access (admin, user, public, etc)
get_my_users is probably not needed since we view all users
security check: get rid of unused functions
deletion
check out the log info -- see if it's what we want
head chef pulldown sorted by who has done it the least
color gray/white to distinguish different lines in the edit/view meal table
prev/next month navigation in easy-to-find spot
for add meal, check to make sure end date is after start date
    and check to make sure there is some day of the week clicked for repeating meals
    add another save button at the top
default time and number of crew should be according to spec
more useful activity log (more descriptive actions)
