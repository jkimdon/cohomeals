install apache2, php5, php5-mysql, mysql-client-5.0, mysql-server-5.0

In /etc/apache2/sites-available/, copy default and add (or just add to default):

Alias /meals "/home/jkimdon/newStuff/coho/meals/cohomeals/cohomeals/trunk"
<Directory "/home/jkimdon/newStuff/coho/meals/cohomeals/cohomeals/trunk">
	   Options Indexes 
	   AllowOverride None
	   Order deny,allow
	   Deny from all
	   Allow from 127.0.0.0/255.0.0.0 ::1/128
</Directory>



Then make symlink in sites-enabled to use the new sites-available
instead of the default


clear firefox cache then
/etc/init.d/apache2 restart
